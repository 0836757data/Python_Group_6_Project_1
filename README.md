This repository is a collection of group project work to teach how to write Python code to store the data in a database, and then serve that data up via a website. The source files are processed using the Jupyter LAB.

Data collection has been done from kaggle( https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gan2gan/austin-bicycle-crashes-from-20102017?rvi=1) and we cleaned some of our data for our project.
